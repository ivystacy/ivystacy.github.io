          <p class="tools-text"><b>Python | Jupyter Notebook</b></p>
          <p>During my summer internship at the Port of Seattle, my team and I
            worked on implementing and testing preliminary machine learning
            models to detect dangerous objects (such as suitcases, strollers,
            ect.) on airport escalators, aiming to improve the safety of
            travellers.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div id="more" style=display:none>
          <div class="column">
            <p>Over six weeks, the machine learning team worked on various
              methods of detection. Using transfer learning, I worked on a
              binary classification model that would sort images displaying
              different escalator situations into two categories, safe and
              unsafe. Even though our dataset was limited, the model was able
              to sort the images at an accuracy rate of 81%.</p>
            <p>The preparation, training and testing process can be
              viewed in depth

          <p class="tools-text"><b>JavaScript | App Lab</b></p>
          <p>This was one of my favorite projects that I worked on while
            participating in CSE Startup at the University of Washington.
            We were to create a user-centered app that was simple to understand
            and easy to navigate. I decided to implement an app targeted to
            indecisive bubble tea customers where they are able to generate
            random drinks and then save their favorite combinations.

          <p>In the making of this project, various trials were completed to
          determine whether users were able to complete a series of tasks
          using the app. With this, we frequently took user feedback and
          made adjustments to ensure that the app was as user-friendly as
          possible. Check out the final app

          <p class="tools-text"><b>HTML | CSS | JavaScript</b></p>
          <p>I was first introduced to computer science when I participated in
            the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. Over the summer, I
            gained exposure to Python, HTML, Arduino and much more. As the
            final project, I collaborated on an interactive website 'Ctrl
            Save' which aimed raise awareness for endangered species.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div id="more3" style=display:none>
          <p>When you enter the 'Ctrl Save' webpage, you first play a game
            that intends to capture the POV of an endangered animal. The moment
            you lose, you are redirected to a page where there is information
            about the actions you can take to help at-risk species.
            This was the first coding project that I ever worked on, so there
            are some imperfections, but it provided a great learning
            experience for my classmates and I!</p>
